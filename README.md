## Introduction and Disclaimer

IMPORTANT NOTE

This document is a GS1 White Paper only. Specifically, it is neither a ratified application standard nor a ratified implementation guideline, i.e. it is not approved by any GS1/GS1 Germany board or committee. It is intended to provide a possible 'best guess' solution on how to meet the EUDR's requirements applying GS1 standards. Further, it is considered to serve as input for future GS1 standardisation activities in this domain.

## EPCIS event message specification

### Preliminary remark

Note that none of the specified EPCIS user extension fields are standardised yet. This is why the latter are declared under the `example` namespace.

Once the EPCIS event message structures are  standardised, e.g. in a GS1 application standard, the respective sections should be updated accordingly.


## EPCIS message examples
